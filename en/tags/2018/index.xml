      <description>Before I start&amp;hellip; One year ago was my first on-site hacking event : GreHack 2017. The conferences were great, I met a few people there, and the CaptureTheFlag was awesome, even tho I had almost no knowledge, there&amp;rsquo;s always a starting point huh ? I spent the whole year doing my best to gain hacking knowledge, meet people into infosec, solve challenges, join events, conferences, CTFs, &amp;hellip;
Some were great, but I still had the memories of this awesome event, and thought that the conference were the best (no marketing bullshit, only precise knowledge shared by interesting people).</description>
