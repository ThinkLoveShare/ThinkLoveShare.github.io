      <description>The root cause Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing, I was doing some cleaning in my computer&amp;rsquo;s home directory after solving some hacking challenge. To see what kind of files where still present I ran the command ta, which is aliased (in my system) to the following function.
ta () { tree -ah &amp;quot;$@&amp;quot; | lolcat; }  It lists my files recursively, showing hidden files and putting some neat rainbow colors at the same time.</description>

      <description>Datadog parties A few times a month, parties are organized either at work, or in cool places nearby by the company. So far, I joined three times. Once to taste some whiskey, once to build our own terrarium and eat hand-made sushis, and once to go to a big-games bar. And every event was a huge success! :D
There are many interns, and the vibes are always chill / funny.</description>

      <description>Have you seen my home? During the first week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been living with Tatiana and Mateo in a flat just below Central Park, the flat itself was really nice, but still had one problem: the building have a very strict guests policy. It was forbidden to sublease a room due to recent regulations in New-York (mainly because of RBNB&amp;rsquo;s overnight guests and&amp;hellip; MONEY of course!). Each night, going back to the building was easy, but reaching the flat was pretty challenging.</description>

      <description>Before I start&amp;hellip; You&amp;rsquo;ve been quite a lot (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting that much to be honest) to ask me for news. I&amp;rsquo;d like to spend hours speaking with each of you, but the thing is that with all I have to do during the first week (register into administrative stuff, open a bank account, get well in the place, start work, socialize a bit, recover some sleep, &amp;hellip;) and the fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t have the right phone package yet.</description>

      <description>Why changing ? I used to write from time to time on thinkloveshare.blogspot.com which will soon be retired, replaced by thinkloveshare.com. I decided to change for quite a few reasons, here&amp;rsquo;s the story:
 Code format  There was no easy way to display code snippets. I could have added some js beautifier / pretty printers, but I lacked time, so instead of that was just putting screenshots which is&amp;hellip; Probably the worst choice possible&amp;hellip; =]</description>

      <description>Before I start&amp;hellip; One year ago was my first on-site hacking event : GreHack 2017 !
The conferences were great, I met a few cool people there, and the CaptureTheFlag was awesome, even tho I had almost no knowledge, there&amp;rsquo;s always a starting point huh ? I spent the whole year doing my best to gain hacking knowledge, meet people into infosec, solve challenges, join events, conferences, CTFs, &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Description  Are you a real math wiz?
nc misc.chal.csaw.io 9002
 TL;DR This challenge consists in equations being thrown at us that we have to solve and send the result in order to get the flag. Python and sage, I invoke you !
Methology A friend I was talking with while solving this chall told me :
 Well, the equations are simple, let&amp;rsquo;s write a quick script to solve it !</description>

      <guid>https://thinkloveshare.github.io/en/writeups/csaw_2018/big_boi/</guid>
      <description>Description  Only big boi pwners will get this one!
nc pwn.chal.csaw.io 9000
 You can download the ELF here
TL;DR This challenge is a simple buffer overflow with a check that may lead to code execution. It&amp;rsquo;s an easy pwn, so one liner is the way to go !
Methology Step 1 : Use IDA to decompile the program and avoid losing time, then overflow it with the good value many time to access the &amp;ldquo;/bin/bash&amp;rdquo; statement.</description>

      <description>Description  Linked lists are great! They let you chain pieces of data together.
nc pwn.chal.csaw.io 9005
 You can download the ELF file : here
TL;DR This challenge uses linked list and leaks an address, the stack is executable, a short shellcode and a relative jump will do the trick !
Methology Step 1 : Use IDA to decompile the program, find the two useful functions that fills the linked list and expose the buffer overflow.</description>

      <description>Description  Start from the monkey&amp;rsquo;s paw and work your way down the high voltage line, for every wire that is branches off has an element that is either on or off. Ignore the first bit. Standard flag format.
-Elyk
 TL;DR This challenge consists in the analysis of a lovely electronic scheme.
It is composed of diodes, wires, wires, wires and wires.
The goal is to extract bits of data from the circuit.</description>

      <title>Security Fest - Excess ess 1</title>

      <guid>https://thinkloveshare.github.io/en/writeups/security_fest_2018/excess_ess_1/</guid>
      <description>This challenge is called &amp;ldquo;Excess Ess 1&amp;rdquo;, a funny name for XSS, which is an attack that consists in forcing our victim&amp;rsquo;s browser to execute code (most of the time javascript) without its consent. This challenge was proposed by the 2018&amp;rsquo;s edition of the SecurityFest CTF.
The goal Most of the time, to prove that an XSS is possible, the hacker provides a payload that pops an alert. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we&amp;rsquo;re asked to do.</description>

      <description>Hello dear reader,
Today, I would like to talk to you about a deep subject, but in a very superficial way. I would like to talk to you about our society, the groups that are born, live and die in it. Groups, of course, but focused on the individuals who compose them, or who oppose to them.
As usual, I will try to share with you a way of seeing things: mine.</description>

      <description>Translation disclaimer This history was written in french, so as my english is still quite&amp;hellip; Meh. So because of the translation, most of the poetry is lost&amp;hellip; But because I can&amp;rsquo;t stand finding resources / articles available only in one language that I can&amp;rsquo;t understand, here&amp;rsquo;s the english version.
Cheers ! ;)
 How about some change ?
How about leaving the technology aside for a while, and just relax with a cup of tea ?</description>

      <description>Today, I propose to take a step back on how to approach problems, research, or even&amp;hellip;. Life in general?
Prologue What I am going to tell you here is common sense to me, but it took me years to adopt these few methods, and even then, sometimes I forget to use them and quickly regret it.
I will therefore present some ideas and techniques that will serve you in your studies (cuckoo math and physics that hurts!</description>
