      <description>Why changing ? I used to write from time to time on thinkloveshare.blogspot.com which will soon be retired, replaced by thinkloveshare.com. I decided to change for quite a few reasons, here&amp;rsquo;s the story:
 Code format  There was no easy way to display code snippets. I could have added some js beautifier / pretty printers, but I lacked time, so instead of that was just putting screenshots which is&amp;hellip; Probably the worst choice possible&amp;hellip; =]</description>

      <description>Before I start&amp;hellip; One year ago was my first on-site hacking event : GreHack 2017 !
The conferences were great, I met a few cool people there, and the CaptureTheFlag was awesome, even tho I had almost no knowledge, there&amp;rsquo;s always a starting point huh ? I spent the whole year doing my best to gain hacking knowledge, meet people into infosec, solve challenges, join events, conferences, CTFs, &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This challenge is called &amp;ldquo;Excess Ess 1&amp;rdquo;, a funny name for XSS, which is an attack that consists in forcing our victim&amp;rsquo;s browser to execute code (most of the time javascript) without its consent. This challenge was proposed by the 2018&amp;rsquo;s edition of the SecurityFest CTF.
The goal Most of the time, to prove that an XSS is possible, the hacker provides a payload that pops an alert. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we&amp;rsquo;re asked to do.</description>

Pwn Road, last introductory article! I promised you some heavy stuff for the final, and what is said, is due!</description>

      <title>A question of standards?</title>

      <description>Hello dear reader,
Today, I would like to talk to you about a deep subject, but in a very superficial way. I would like to talk to you about our society, the groups that are born, live and die in it. Groups, of course, but focused on the individuals who compose them, or who oppose to them.
As usual, I will try to share with you a way of seeing things: mine.</description>

      <description>Translation disclaimer This history was written in french, so as my english is still quite&amp;hellip; Meh. So because of the translation, most of the poetry is lost&amp;hellip; But because I can&amp;rsquo;t stand finding resources / articles available only in one language that I can&amp;rsquo;t understand, here&amp;rsquo;s the english version.
Cheers ! ;)
 How about some change ?
How about leaving the technology aside for a while, and just relax with a cup of tea ?</description>

      <description>Today, I propose to take a step back on how to approach problems, research, or even&amp;hellip;. Life in general?
Prologue What I am going to tell you here is common sense to me, but it took me years to adopt these few methods, and even then, sometimes I forget to use them and quickly regret it.
I will therefore present some ideas and techniques that will serve you in your studies (cuckoo math and physics that hurts!</description>
