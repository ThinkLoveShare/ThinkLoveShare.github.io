      <description>Before I start&amp;hellip; One year ago was my first on-site hacking event : GreHack 2017 !
The conferences were great, I met a few people there, and the CaptureTheFlag was awesome, even tho I had almost no knowledge, there&amp;rsquo;s always a starting point huh ? I spent the whole year doing my best to gain hacking knowledge, meet people into infosec, solve challenges, join events, conferences, CTFs, &amp;hellip;
Some were great, but I still had the memories of this awesome event, and thought that the conference were the best (no marketing bullshit, only precise knowledge shared by interesting people).</description>

      <description>This challenge is called &amp;ldquo;Excess Ess 1&amp;rdquo;, a funny name for XSS, which is an attack that consists in forcing our victim&amp;rsquo;s browser to execute code (most of the time javascript) without its consent. This challenge was proposed by the 2018&amp;rsquo;s edition of the SecurityFest CTF.
The goal Most of the time, to prove that an XSS is possible, the hacker provides a payload that pops an alert. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we&amp;rsquo;re asked to do.</description>

      <title>A question of standards?</title>

      <description>Hello dear reader,
Today, I would like to talk to you about a deep subject, but in a very superficial way. I would like to talk to you about our society, the groups that are born, live and die in it. Groups, of course, but focused on the individuals who compose them, or who oppose to them.
As usual, I will try to share with you a way of seeing things: mine.</description>

      <description>Translation disclaimer This history was written in french, so as my english is still quite&amp;hellip; Meh. So because of the translation, most of the poetry is lost&amp;hellip; But because I can&amp;rsquo;t stand finding resources / articles available only in one language that I can&amp;rsquo;t understand, here&amp;rsquo;s the english version.
Cheers ! ;)
 How about some change ?
How about leaving the technology aside for a while, and just relax with a cup of tea ?</description>
