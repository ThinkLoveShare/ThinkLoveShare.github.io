      <description>Hey, you! Aren’t you tired of always having broken tools relying on broken software? Pissed off because you just broke your system (againnn&amp;hellip;) trying to fix your previously broken tools and now everything’s fucked-up and you want to raise penguins out of the tech world? Or even worse, you want a reverse shell but you’re :

      <description>Before I start&amp;hellip; One year ago was my first on-site hacking event : GreHack 2017 !
The conferences were great, I met a few cool people there, and the CaptureTheFlag was awesome, even tho I had almost no knowledge, there&amp;rsquo;s always a starting point huh ? I spent the whole year doing my best to gain hacking knowledge, meet people into infosec, solve challenges, join events, conferences, CTFs, &amp;hellip;</description>

   Pwn Road, last introductory article! I promised you some heavy stuff for the final, and what is said, is due!</description>
