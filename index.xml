      <description>This article is the transcript of a talk (FR) I gave at the opening of the CTF platform TheBlackSide on 29th January 2022.

  Hi there, long time no see! :)
I hope you like tooling, bash scripting, and uber-duper shells, because we&amp;rsquo;re going to enhance the sad shells we had to happy automated multiplexed encrypted fully interactive PTYs with push notification and automatic persistency!
Hyped? I hope so.</description>

      <description>Second article of the Failed series! We often read articles or research that explain how to exploit X or how Y works. Most of the time this seems straightforward, and yet we all struggle doing our own research. We &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; that failing is &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s part of the process, yet it can hurt or make you feel bad.
 The path I now want to take, is the wrong one.</description>

      <title>RCE with SSRF and File Write as an exploit chain on Apache Guacamole</title>
      <link>https://thinkloveshare.com/hacking/hacking_guacamole_to_trigger_avocado/</link>

      <guid>https://thinkloveshare.com/hacking/hacking_guacamole_to_trigger_avocado/</guid>
      <description>While doing research on various topics, I stood upon Guacamole, a software that can be used as a connection bastion or protocolar gateway. It has many original vulnerabilities that lead to a Remote Code Execution once chained. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin, shall we?
What the doc says Apache Guacamole is a clientless remote desktop gateway. It supports standard protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH.
Setup the test environment There is a clear documentation that explains the setup process both with and without docker, you can read it here:</description>

      <description>TL;DR: I&amp;rsquo;m finally releasing JET, a Jolokia Exploitation Toolkit! To introduct this tool &amp;amp; repo, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain in detail how to get code execution with jolokia and Tomcat/Catalina Mbeans! :)
 Oops, I did it again. I spent too much time on Jolokia, this is a fact. Now, I want you to be able to get shells as well, and I also would like the community to contribute to this project so no jolokia can never ever survive to its pentester again.</description>

      <description>First article of a new series! Exciting isn&amp;rsquo;t it? We often read articles or research that explain how to exploit X or how Y works. Most of the time this seems straightforward, and yet we all struggle doing our own research.

The cause of this bug is simple: The lack of input sanitization

      <description>Hi there, This article is about Spip, root-me.org, XSS, SQLi, and Remote Code Execution. Ever wondered how secure is your daily website ? Welcome. To. Php.
Quick disclaimer before we start:  In May the 23rd 2020, someone took over an admin account on root-me by password reuse and threatened to leak solutions and flags. There is no beauty in this act, no technical skill required, nor good purpose. This is just part of the &amp;ldquo;be an asshole&amp;rdquo; mindset.</description>

      <description>From time to time, I help friends to troubleshoot issues. Coding, system administration, hacking, pretty much anything as it&amp;rsquo;s a good opportunity to learn from what they are doing, and teach cool tricks at the same time. One big issue though is that I really rarely have a decent connection. Thus, using common tools such as TeamViewer, Anydesk, RDP, on anything else isn&amp;rsquo;t really working well, crashing, extra slow, &amp;hellip; So.</description>

      <description>The initial idea While auditing a website, I found out they were using websockets to transmit data. I didn&amp;rsquo;t kow much about it so I had to ReadTheFancyManual. Once I understood that it was&amp;hellip; Well&amp;hellip; A socket one could use with web technologies, I asked myself &amp;ldquo;What do I usually do with sockets?&amp;rdquo;
Tunnels! Transfer files! Or&amp;hellip; Spawn reverse shells?!
Or&amp;hellip; Spawn a reverse XSShell??
What do we need? A websocket server import asyncio import websockets async def hello(websocket, path): print(&amp;quot;WebSocket received&amp;quot;) while True: cmd = input(&amp;quot;cmd &amp;gt; &amp;quot;) await websocket.</description>

      <description>About a month ago, I had to audit a wordpress website. As it was one of my first real-life pentest, I was really hyped and ready to try extra-super-hard to compromise this target. But after a few hours, I realised that :
 Wordpress is up to date Every plugin or theme is up to date There is no custom code (At least, I found none using gobuster and big wordlists) There is no weak credentials (Same, I found none doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there&amp;rsquo;s none.</description>

      <title>SSHrc and telegram apis</title>

      <guid>https://thinkloveshare.com/coding/sshrc_and_telegram_apis/</guid>
      <description>The root cause While casually chatting with a colleague, he told me about the sshrc feature of sshd. He explained to me that he was using telegram&amp;rsquo;s API to get ssh login notifications on his phone. My first thought was &amp;ldquo;Yeah, sure, but it&amp;rsquo;s just a .rc file (custom settings), it&amp;rsquo;s usually quite easy to bypass with the right option&amp;hellip;
While saying that, I had in mind the trick with bash --noprofile --norc that can allow a new bash process to be spawned without using any configuration file.</description>

      <description>Hey, you! Aren’t you tired of always having broken tools relying on broken software? Pissed off because you just broke your system (againnn&amp;hellip;) trying to fix your previously broken tools and now everything’s fucked-up and you want to raise penguins out of the tech world? Or even worse, you want a reverse shell but you’re :
 At your grandparents place and they lost the router password so you can’t expose ports So broke that you can’t buy nor rent a virtual private server  Well that’s oddly specific but you’re on the exact right place on earth (and on the web)!</description>

      <description>The root cause Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing, I was doing some cleaning in my computer&amp;rsquo;s home directory after solving some hacking challenge. To see what kind of files where still present I ran the command ta, which is aliased (in my system) to the following function.
ta () { tree -ah &amp;quot;$@&amp;quot; | lolcat; }  It lists my files recursively, showing hidden files and putting some neat rainbow colors at the same time.</description>

Once to taste some whiskey, once to build our own terrarium and eat hand-made sushis, and once to go to a big-games bar. And every event was a huge success! :D
There are many interns, and the vibes are always chill / funny.</description>

      <description>Have you seen my home? During the first week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been living with Tatiana and Mateo in a flat just below Central Park, the flat itself was really nice, but still had one problem: the building have a very strict guests policy. It was forbidden to sublease a room due to recent regulations in New-York (mainly because of RBNB&amp;rsquo;s overnight guests and&amp;hellip; MONEY of course!). Each night, going back to the building was easy, but reaching the flat was pretty challenging.</description>

      <description>Description  Only big boi pwners will get this one!
nc pwn.chal.csaw.io 9000
 You can download the ELF here
TL;DR This challenge is a simple buffer overflow with a check that may lead to code execution. It&amp;rsquo;s an easy pwn, so one liner is the way to go !
Methology Step 1 : Use IDA to decompile the program and avoid losing time, then overflow it with the good value many time to access the &amp;ldquo;/bin/bash&amp;rdquo; statement.</description>

      <description>Description  Linked lists are great! They let you chain pieces of data together.
nc pwn.chal.csaw.io 9005
 You can download the ELF file : here
TL;DR This challenge uses linked list and leaks an address, the stack is executable, a short shellcode and a relative jump will do the trick !
Methology Step 1 : Use IDA to decompile the program, find the two useful functions that fills the linked list and expose the buffer overflow.</description>

      <description>This challenge is called &amp;ldquo;Excess Ess 1&amp;rdquo;, a funny name for XSS, which is an attack that consists in forcing our victim&amp;rsquo;s browser to execute code (most of the time javascript) without its consent. This challenge was proposed by the 2018&amp;rsquo;s edition of the SecurityFest CTF.
The goal Most of the time, to prove that an XSS is possible, the hacker provides a payload that pops an alert. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we&amp;rsquo;re asked to do.</description>
